#simpson_index_cl= Income from each crop and livestock is divided by total_crop_liv. The ratio is p. Then p is squared and added. This gives simpson_index_cl. 
#effective_crop=Inverse of simpson_index_cl.
#simpson_index_sources=Income from each of six sources(income_wages, income_ft,income_other,income_crop, income_livestock,income_loan) is divided by total_income. The ratio is p. Then p i squared and added. this gives simpson_index_sources.
#effective_sources=Inverse of simpson_index_sources.
#simpson_index_sources_no_loan=Income from each of five sources(income_wages, income_ft,income_other,income_crop, income_livestock) is divided by total_income_no_loan. The ratio is p. Then p is squared and added. this gives simpson_index_sources_no_loan.
